# Management Cluster Bases

Note: We may refer to this repository using the acronym **MCB**.

## Purpose of this repository

At Giant Swarm, we apply GitOps to provision and configure management clusters. This **public** repository holds common configuration used by all management clusters.

In addition, each Giant Swarm customer has their dedicated repository for private and specific configuration.

To learn more about how GitOps works with Giant Swarm, check our [GitOps documentation](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/gitops/gitops-at-giantswarm/).
