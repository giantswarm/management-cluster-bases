## Some hints on changes to this repository

### Public information only

This is a public repository. The content and commit history is visible to everyone.

Do not provide any **customer-specific details**. Use the customer's repository for that.

### Descriptive PR title

Please write a descriptive pull request title. In this repo we don't maintain a changelog file, so the PR title (becoming the commit message after squash-merge) is the main information to understand a change in retrospect.
